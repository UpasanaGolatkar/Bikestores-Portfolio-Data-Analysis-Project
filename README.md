# Bikestores-Portfolio-Data-Analysis-Project

Bikestores Data Analysis Project

This project showcases my expertise in data analytics through a detailed analysis of Bikestores data. The project follows the five key steps of data analytics to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize data:


Data Generation: I began by writing a detailed SQL script to generate the Bikestores dataset. The script was executed on SQL Server to extract structured data from the database.

Data Import: The SQL-generated data was imported into Excel for further manipulation and analysis. Excel served as the primary tool for initial data handling.

Dynamic Dashboard Creation in Excel: Using pivot tables in Excel, I created dynamic and interactive dashboards to provide insightful data summaries and visualizations. These dashboards were designed to allow for easy updates and real-time interaction.

Data Connection with Tableau: I connected the cleaned and structured data from Excel to Tableau. Tableau was used to import the data for advanced visualizations and enhanced interaction.

Final Visualization: In Tableau, I designed a visually appealing and dynamic dashboard that presents the Bikestores data in a compelling way, allowing for in-depth exploration of the key insights from the data.

This project demonstrates my skills in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and the end-to-end data analytics process, from data generation to dashboard design.
